revpid (revpi userspace daemon)


The revpi daemon constantly polls the analog and digital input lines and provides fast access to 
the read values. This is required if the revpi_control library is initialized with REVPI_CTRL_ACCESS_DAEMON.

If you want this for ARM build with

#  make CC=<ARM_COMPILER>

Note: to avoid build errors, first build the revpi_control library before building the daemon.
