Hardware Setup:
The sample program "revpi_control_test" assumes that digital output 1 is physically wired
with digital input 1. 

Program Execution:
The sample program "revpi_control_test" first sets all digital outputs (0 to 7) to zero. Then
it sets the digital outputs 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 to 1. It then enters a loop and waits for 
the digital input 1 to return 1. If this value is perceived the loop is left.

A timestamp is taken before the digital outputs are set and after the above mentioned loop is left.
The time difference between both timestamps is printed to the console.
